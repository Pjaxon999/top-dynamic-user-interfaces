# Lessons Learned #  
I still have a long way to go with my CSS. Making things look good is going to be hard for me going forward!
On the other hand, writing the necessary scripts went really well and I think I did a good job with it.  
I learned a lot from the design phase of this by mapping out exactly what functionality I would need which led  
me to be much more efficient with my code.
